# Hiding desk phone number from caller ID

To place a call so that your desk phone number \(not your cell number\) will appear in the caller ID. 

## Steps:

* First access an idle appearance on your desk phone by calling **512-978-4899**
* Then when you hear dial tone enter the 5-digit internal extension number you are calling or the outside number as if you were sitting at your desk phone \(for example: 9512-974-2000\)
