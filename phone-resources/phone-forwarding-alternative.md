{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/avaya-onex-communicator-softphone.docx" %}

Above are the CTM instructions on how to use the phone software, but I found it to be slightly unclear. 

## **Assumptions**: 

* Have an issued **COA computer hardware** \(laptop, Lenovo tablet/laptops, desktop\)
* VPN accessibility \(Cisco **AnyConnect**, **NetMotion** only - Citrix will not work\)
* **USB headset**
* Admin on your computer \(_You can download software to your computer\)_ 

  * or CTM or Scott can download software 

### Downloading Software \(as Admin\)

1. Navigate to [**\\coacd.org\dfs\PCIP\Public\_Software\Avaya**](file://coacd.org/dfs/PCIP/Public_Software/Avaya) **Client\SoftPhone\OneXCommunicator** on the windows file explorer
2. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2894%29.png)
3. Click the `Avaya one-X Communicator` \(Windows Installer Package\)
4. This should download the software and place a shortcut link on your desktop

### Logging In

1. click the `Avaya one-X Communicator` icon from you desktop
2. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28104%29.png)

### To place a call

#### Assumptions: 

* You’re logged in 

1. Click the “phone” icon
2. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2852%29.png)
3. Click \`Show Dialpad\`
4. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2888%29.png)
5. ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2842%29.png)
6. Use the dial pad to make your outgoing call
7. To make a call to an internal COA number, dial:
   1. 4\(extension\) - _Just like your desk phone_
8. To make a call to an outside number dial:
   1. 91\(phone number\) \( ex. 915129740000\)

### TIPS

You may need a USB headset to hear your calls if you're not able to hear/talk using your computer's microphone. Computers towers will need headsets as they do not have build in microphones. _\(When I tried it, I was able to use my laptop microphone without using a headset\)_
