## Avaya Unified Messaging - How to access voicemail via e-mail

Unified messaging \(or UM\) is a business term for the integration of different electronic messaging and communications media \(e-mail, SMS, fax, voicemail, video messaging, etc.\) technologies into a single interface, accessible from a variety of different devices. This Avaya UM User Guide will focus only on the voicemail feature and how to access that voicemail via e-mail. 

#### Notes

* The Avaya UM software creates an audio file and attaches it to an e-mail. 
* The e-mail will come from **ctmavayaalerts@austintexas.gov.** 
* The message light on the desk phone **will not** indicate a voicemail has been received. 
* The Avaya voicemail system server **automatically deletes** original audio recordings after **fourteen \(14\) days**. 
* The **e-mail owner is responsible** for identifying potential records that may need records retention management – same as any other e-mail that is received and identified as a record. 
* The e-mail owner should manage their voicemails according to their department Records Retention Management Policy _\(seek guidance from management\)_ if applicable.
