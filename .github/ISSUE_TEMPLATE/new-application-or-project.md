# How might we _____________ ?
<!-- What is the root problem you are trying to solve? A properly framed 'How Might We' doesn’t suggest a particular solution, but gives you room to consider a variety of innovative solutions -->

## Challenge
<!-- Describe the overall need in a paragraph or two. What is the problem and what impact does it have on ATD operations and/or service delivery to residents? -->

## Request
<!-- Do you have a solution in mind that you recommend? -->

## Target users
<!-- Who will use this solution? -->

## Stakeholders
<!-- Who will work with the Data and Technology Services team on this project? --> 

## What else should we know?

## How would you rate the impact of this issue?
- [ ] Must have — ATD operations are not legal, unsafe, or functional without it.
- [ ] Should have — This is important but not vital functionality or there is a temporary workaround.

- [ ] Unsure
