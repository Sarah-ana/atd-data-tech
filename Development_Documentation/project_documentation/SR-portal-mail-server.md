### Initial project email



The use case is this: I want to create a new Service Request in the DTS Portal by sending an email.



I imagine the tooling would look roughly like this:

\- a Python smtpd mail server is created to receive new email messages

\- the mail server calls a function to parse expected values from the email message

\- the message contents are passed to knackpy,  which creates a record in the selected application



It looks like smtpd is pretty simple (but I have not used it):

<https://pymotw.com/2/smtpd/>

This also seems to be a popular 3rd-party Python mail server:

the server will be on one of the AWS server. 

Let me know what you think. I think the Knack community would also be interested in this tool!
