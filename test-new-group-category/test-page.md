## Playing with GitBook

Here is a screen shot of the thing I need to show.

Adding a screen shot was pretty painless, you can upload an image. However you can't just copy and paste it. The image has to be saved on the computer. 

Now I have to track down where GitBook saved this on our GitHub repo.
