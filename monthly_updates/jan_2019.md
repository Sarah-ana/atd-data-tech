# Data & Technology Services Update | January 2019

## Personnel Update
Robert Powell retired last month after 24 years of service. Those of you who had the pleasure of working with Robert over the years know that he was a kind and dedicated public servant as well as a talented geospatial analyst. Congratulations and best wishes to Robert in his retirement. I have Robert's personal email address if you'd like to stay in touch.

This month we welcome Matt Stevens to the team as an IT Geospatial Technician. Matt previously worked for the City of Killeen and has experience managing spatial transportation data. Happy to have you aboard, Matt!
