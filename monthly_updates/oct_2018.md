## Did you know?

Next week marks the one-year anniversary of the traffic signal work orders module of the  [Data Tracker](https://transportation.austintexas.io/data-tracker). Traffic signal technicians have since submitted more than 6,500 electronic work orders. Way to go! 

## Project Highlights

You can find all of our active and planned projects on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/pNbgaKme/data-technology-services-operations).

### Pavement Markings Data Release | Completed

We are excited to announce the public release of more than 40,000 pavement markings asset records. These datasets represent three years of work carried out by GIS staff—most recently by Susanne Gov—and are now a vast resource for city staff, researchers, and the public. Of particular note is the short lines dataset, which contains information on the location and condition of every crosswalk in Austin. We're not aware of any other municipality in the country that has published this kind of information at this level of detail.

### Purchase Request System Upgrade | Complete

The new [Finance and Purchasing system](https://atd.knack.com/finance-purchasing#home/) goes live tomorrow, November 1. Check your email for details on access, training, and support. 

### Dockless Mobility Analysis and Explorer App  | In Progress

The team has provided maps and analysis of dockless mobility data in support of efforts to identify dockless parking facilities. We're also moving quickly to develop an interactive map for exploring Austin's dockless mobility data. The map will allow users to interactively explore origin/destination trip patterns based on mode.

### Waze Feed Archive | In Progress

Work is underway to automatically archive and publish Austin's real-time Waze incident feed, which is available to us through the Waze Connected Citizens Program. This incident database will serve as new resource for studying the patterns and impacts of roadway incidents.

### Traffic Registry Digitization | In Progress

Progress continues on the mapping and digitization of the traffic registry. AECOM reports that they have successfully automated approx. 70% of the digitization process and are on track to complete their work by Q2.

### Road Closure Coordination Automation | In Progress

Discovery is about to begin for identifying improvements to road closure coordination and notifications via AMANDA. Tracy Linder will be contacting stakeholders in November.
