### Document storage and collaboration guidelines üìù üìö

‚ÄãTo prevent the proliferation of different versions of multi-editor documents, all collaborative documents are stored on the cloud:

* [Document templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Txqc8xGkwa3h9lrRoXGzGjLlVo0S8DA6)
* ‚Äã[DTS Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fNmU-czryk5wJsn1gmb4WYUJJdut8Me7)‚Äã - [‚Äãaccount setup](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/wiki/Using-Google-as-a-City-employee)‚Äã‚Äã
* [DTS Sharepoint/Teams drive](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/tab::7dc26d1f-21aa-43dd-9dd9-ab25188b15a7/General?threadId=19:6125816a2bd34142a9b23fc916a968b8%40thread.skype&ctx=channel)

Other documents can be stored either in the cloud or on the [ATD departmental network G drive](https://coacd.org/dfs/ATD), whichever is most practical for the project team and customer.

GIS files are stored on the [ATD departmental network G drive](https://coacd.org/dfs/ATD).

Any private documents such as personnel-related files should be stored on the H drive.

Nothing should be stored on your local drive ‚Äî the Windows C drive or Mac HD. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è

### VPN & Remote Access

You need to be on the City of Austin internal network to access various resources such as shared network drives, the HR Portal, the original CitySpace, and many City of Austin Sharepoint sites.

* CiscoAnyConnect VPN is the client we use to remotely connect to the City network from a Mac.

### Use of personal devices

If you use your personal computer for work at the any CoA office be advised that you should never directly connect to the CoA Ethernet network. You can connect to the CoA internal network via VPN when necessary. CTM runs occasional security scans for devices that shouldn't be on the network and if they discover your personal computer, they reserve the right to take your computer, run scans, and review files.
