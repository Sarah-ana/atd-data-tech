# Working Remotely

### Teleworking Software

* Software available: _Citrix, Cisco AnyConnect, GoToMyPC_
  * This would need to be installed by Scott Reedy
  * Teleworking should be approved your supervisor and the teleworking safety/schedule document signed.
  * Some of these licenses cost money \(_ex. GoToMyPC_\)

### Online Meetings

According to Scott, most if not all of you should already have Skype on your computer.

First thing is first, check if your computer has it already installed. Click on the start button on the bottom left of your screen and begin typing “Skype”. You may see Skype, but we want to make sure “Skype for Business” is installed as well.

**Step 1: Search if Skype is already installed**  
 Microsoft Skype

 **Step 2: Log in**  
 You will want to enter in your work email, it may also take you to the city’s log in page where you’ll need to enter your email address and network \(computer password\).

If you didn’t know, you can create a meeting that has remote access to Ms Skype or Ms Teams.

**Step 3: \(Optional\)** Open Outlook and go to the calendar tab and you’ll see on the menu bar these options. It will add a remote meeting link to your meeting invite and a phone number for users to call. You can choose to call in using the phone line or using your computer to be on the call \(headphones may be required\). When using laptops some can allow you talk through your computer’s microphone.

_NOTE: Skype for Business is being retired by Microsoft. CTM staff have ceased use of Skype in their Department, they are solely using MS Teams. A lot of other departments are also slowly transitioning from Skype to Teams._

Another alternative is Microsoft Teams \(MS Teams\). I think some of you are using this application already. This has the same functionality as Skype allowing you to chat/connect remotely to a meeting and screen share.

**Step 1: Search if Teams is already installed**  
 Microsoft Teams

 **Step 2: It will have a similar log in page to Skype.** _\(You’ll need your city email and network password.\)_
