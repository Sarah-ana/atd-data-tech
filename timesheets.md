# Timesheets

{% hint style="info" %}
During your first two weeks you'll have to fill out a paper timesheet. Request a blank paper timesheet from your supervisor by Day 3.
{% endhint %}

Your timesheet must be submitted in the [eTimesheet](https://pwdweb.austintexas.gov/timesheet/pwd.cfm) system every Thursday by 10am. 

Learn how to submit your timesheet with the  [E-Timesheet Training Guide](http://coaspweb1/sites/PWD/PWU/SitePages/ATDLearn.aspx) \(on-network\) and  [timesheet code](https://cityofaustin.sharepoint.com/sites/ATD/Administration/SitePages/Earn%20Codes.aspx) reference.
