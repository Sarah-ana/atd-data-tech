# Using Box to share large files

## Box

The city uses Box.com as their preferred file sharing platform, it has been through COA Security and approved for use. It is a cloud hosted software that provides file sharing capabilities. The intended use is for files that are too large to send to others through email. 

## Creating an account

Create an account at box.com with your city email address. 

_\(That account should be a full license, any account with the city email address will be flagged to bill.\)_

### Verifying funding 

CTM will send an email within a week or so asking for funding numbers or they will delete the account.

### Sharing Best Practice

* Share files with people can be done so that you can share in a read only mode or edit mode.
* Only people who need to edit files needs a full license.
* You need to grant rights to who you want to share/edit the file. 

### Editing Shared Files - Internally

If someone else in the city wants to edit that file in the Box, they will have to have a paid account also.
