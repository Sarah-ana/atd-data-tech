# Creating Meetings

## **Assumptions:** 

You already have the MS Teams desktop app installed

### **Option 1:** Open Outlook and go to the calendar tab

You’ll see on the menu bar these options. It will add a remote meeting link to your meeting invite and a phone number for users to call. You can choose to call in using the phone line or using your computer to be on the call \(headphones may be required\). When using laptops some can allow you talk through your computer’s microphone.
