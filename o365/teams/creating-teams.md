# Creating Teams

## What is a Team?

* A collaboration hub built on Outlook 365 Groups.​
* Teams are the centralized hub for for **projects, programs, work groups, etc. ​**
* Use a Team when you want to **categorize discussions, manage documents and/or create a Team SharePoint site.​**
* All Teams that are created include a **SharePoint site** and a **General** channel

### O365 Enterprise License - E5/G5

One way to determine if you have E5/G5 license is if you're in MS Outlook trying to create a meeting. 

* You **don't** have the license if you can't see the "**Teams Meeting**" icon on the menu bar _\(you may have an outdated version of Outlook\)_
* If you create a teams meeting and there is **no automatic conference line created**. _\(See below for example\)_

* If you log into [https://www.office.com](https://www.office.com) with your city credentials and **don't** see **PowerBI** application, or if you click the Power BI application it doesn't take you to the PowerBI on the web page.

#### _Troubleshoot:  Teams Meeting add-in in Outlook for Windows_

* If users do **not** see the **Teams Meeting** add-in
* close **Outlook** and **Teams**

In this specific order.

1. Restart the **Teams** client \(first\)
   * Sign in to **Teams**, 
2. Restart the **Outlook** \(second\)

### Don't have the capability?

If you noticed that you don't have the ability to create a Teams meeting or see the conference bridge line creatd. Use MS Skype if not, you can still join Teams meetings, just not organize, talk to your manager if you need a license upgrade

### When NOT to create a Team

If you're just wanting to chat one on one  _\(with one other person\)_ or in a group chat \(a few people at once, but outside a Teams channel\) about day to day things. Not important information that needs to be shared with a group of people. 

#### [Team v. Chat](https://www.sharepointeurope.com/channel-vs-chat-use-microsoft-teams/) \(&lt;-- read more\)

* Channels are public to the team, Chat conversations are private to their members.
* A Channel message do not notifies users by default, conversations do. \(you must @people\)
* Chat history is shown automatically in a channel and optionally in a conversation.
* Channel for FYI message such as people as CC in an email
* Channel for Actionable conversation to certain team members \(using @name in a channel\).
* Chat to replace phone call or direct Skype message when you need quick answer from a limited group of colleagues. 
  * \(_Use it wisely as it would create notification to every conversation members.\)_

### If you have already created a teams using the MS Teams app

Please make sure you do the following: 

* Add ATD SharePoint Administrator, **Diana Martin**, ****as an Owner to your team.
  * This is required so that ATD adminstrators can manage the team if the original owner separates from the city or needs to archive documents according to retention plans.
* Name the team with our standard naming conventions:
  * Department Acronym \(All Caps\) + Division/Work Group acronym \(All Caps\) + Team Namec
    * ex. _ATD DTS Teleworking Support Team_
  * This is required so that CTM Administrators can identify which teams belong to which departments. 

### If you would like to create a new team please submit a:

{% hint style="info" %}
 [DTS Service Request Form](https://atd.knack.com/dts#new-service-request)
{% endhint %}

so that the ATD SharePoint administrator reach out and can discuss your business and purpose of your team. Provide any recommendations if there are specific functions you are trying to achieve.
