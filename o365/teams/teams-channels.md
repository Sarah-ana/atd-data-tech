### Creation of a Team creates a channel

Every team that gets created, gets one channel created called "General". 

Channels are where the work actually gets doneâ€”where [text, audio, and video conversations](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/meetings-in-teams-e0b0ae21-53ee-4462-a50d-ca9b9e217b67) open to the whole team happen, where [files are shared](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-a-file-in-teams-0c4d34ee-5dd8-46d5-ab35-0d227b5e6eb5), and where [apps are added](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-an-app-to-microsoft-teams-b2217706-f7ed-4e64-8e96-c413afd02f77).

While channel conversations are public, **chats** are just between you and someone else \(or a group of people\). Think of them like instant messages in Skype for Business or other messaging apps.
