## Project Highlights

### [Signs Work Order & Asset Management Migration](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-knack-data-tracker/issues/42) | Complete

We have completely transitioned street signs operations from the Maximo system to the Data Tracker. This project includes the development of a new, integrated 311 service request management interface, as well as geospatial signs asset tracking.

### [Right-of-Way Permit Inspection Prioritization](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-amanda/issues/52) | Phase 1 Complete

We developed an automated tool which utilizes multiple data sources to provide ROW inspectors with a prioritized list of their permit inspections, so that the most critical needs are met first. The first version of the tool factors in conditions such as road class, permit duration, and the size of the affected area.

### [Traffic Count Centralization](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/410) | Complete

This project created a new module in the Data Tracker to help streamline the traffic count and data collection request process for our Data Collection team. This helped the tracking of the data requests and made the process transparent and easier.

### [Mobile Signal Work Orders](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-mobile-signals-work-orders) | Beta Release

This month, we begin beta testing our mobile-first application for traffic signal work orders. The app is integrated with the Data Tracker, and allows field technicians to quickly and accurately review and respond to traffic signal issues from a mobile device. 

### [Mobility Project Database](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-mobility-project-database) | In Progress

We completed discovery research focused on Active Transportation's [Interim Project Database](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wja5Hfnchu93j4w7ATYNKO_-5lWixEMyEkulGqIe2l8/edit) and high-level technical strategies. Our [project kickoff with MPD stakeholders](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-mobility-project-database/issues/8#issuecomment-515208937) helped us develop our understanding of user needs and organizational vision. We will soon bring in an external consultant to continue requirements gathering and design the MPD data architecture.

### [Parking Data Overhaul](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-geospatial/issues/23) | In Progress

We are conducting a complete overhaul of our parking asset data. This effort will improve accuracy, reduce redundant data entry, and facilitate integrated curb management for right-of-way permitting and new mobility technologies.

### [Residential Parking Permits](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-residential-parking-permits) | In Progress

The project encapsulates our work to modernize the Residential Parking Permit (RPP) program. The effort includes the procurement or development of a web-based permitting interface, through which residents can easily apply for and renew their residential parking permits.

We have refined user stories, calculated [costs of the current RPP process](https://cityofaustin.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/ResidentialParkingPermitApplication/ESD-2AENhERJph8M7HHXNQMB_XF2LWZ6yrSdCwy56uOuIQ?e=PXUm48), and [compiled requirements](https://cityofaustin.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/ResidentialParkingPermitApplication/EUOIzkWg8EFMgyR2jEvs3DsBDZYQxwNIFJog3nqH1_kXFQ?e=sRDyuz) in an SOW. We are now amending ATD's [ParkATX](https://www.parkatxapp.com/) contract to include a [permitting solution](https://www.passportinc.com/product/permits/) that the vendor, Passport Labs, offers. We will pilot the application for a year before posting a formal RFP for long-term solutions. 

### [Vision Zero Data Management](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-vz-data) | In Progress

This project seeks to centralize and streamline the management of ATD's Vision Zero data. As a result of this project, staff will have a standardized interface for reviewing crash data, prioritizing intersection safety improvements, and communicating efforts to the public.

We have completed work on an automated pipeline from the TxDOT's crash database (CRIS), and are currently readying an alpha version of the crash editing interface.

### [ROWMAN Phase 4](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/422) | In Progress

Phase 4 of the ROWMAN Replacement Project focuses on improving Right of Way Management's ability to coordinate activities in the right of way. The highest priority of this phase is to begin collecting real time closure data from permit applicants.

This phase is active as of 8/12/19. We're currently working on a proof of concept that to share with the team. Once a high level scope of work is approved, a request for an estimate will be sent to Unisys. Next, funding will need to be secured from the Case Management Governing Board. If all goes well, development could start in October.

### [ATD AMANDA Backlog Development](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/432) | Scoping

The purpose of this project is to contract with an AMANDA developer to deliver all items on ATD's AMANDA backlog. This project is still being scoped. The Case Management Governing Board is voting on a request to engage Unisys for this work, for up to $400,00, funded by ATD. The board approved this request on 8/16.

### [Data & Tech Services Delivery Workflow](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/83) | In Progress

We're designing and documenting the processes the DTS team can use to intake, manage, and deliver services. This project is near 60% complete. Currently we are working on finishing the service delivery road map diagrams, creating project document templates, and updating the customer submittal forms.

### [Transportation Data Lake](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/132) | In Progress

This project will enable the City of Austin to house its own transportation data in cloud services and federate data access to our business partners. The first phase of the project is 80% complete. Approximately 15 million [GRIDSMART traffic count records](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Camera-Traffic-Counts/sh59-i6y9 )were published from the data lake to the open data portal last week.


### [DTS Branding, Identity, and Standards](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/115) | In Progress

Our customers, prospective team members, and potential collaborators should understand who we are, what we do, and why it matters. We want them to know us, trust us and join us in our efforts to empower people with the data and technology they need to improve mobility in Austin. After pitching at Github's Open Source for Good volunteer event, we got a small but mighty team of Hubbers to help move this important work forward. ðŸ™Œ 

### [Vision Zero Citation Reportin App](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/145) | In Progress

We are building an app for APD officers to use when making Vision Zero in Action citations. By digitizing the process, we can streamline workflows and collect structured data that we can use to inform VZA program management. We have [interviewed primary users](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/208#issuecomment-506549653) and started [implementation in Knack](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/238). Once the initial prototype is ready, we will do a stakeholder demo, perform usability testing, and iterate on the app. 

### [ArcGIS Online Audit](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/253) | On Hold

The purpose of this project is to clean-up Austin Transportation's ArcGIS Online Content and to form a strategy to keep the Content current moving forward. This will ensure only relevant and accurate data is available via internal and external facing Feature Services, Web Maps, and Web Applications. The initial run through of the data has been completed and documented. Currently on hold pending team availabiltiy.

### [Street Sign Data Collection](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/131) | Discovery

This is an effort to acquire comprehensive citywide street sign data. With the release of our new Signs Work Orders app and attendant GIS processes, we are now accurately tracking the installation and maintenance of our street sign assets. However, we do not have reliable data on the condition and location of our existing street sign assets. This project will evaluate options for acquiring this data through procurement, manual collection, our otherwise. 

### [Traffic Registry Digitization](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/129) | In Progress

This is an effort to digitize all of our street regulations in a geospatial database, as well as set up sustainable processes to keep the Traffic Registry accurately maintained. The registry includes more than 50k regulations, and is currently managed in Access DB, without any spatial data features. AECOMM was authorized to proceed in June. Work is 20% complete. ETA June 2020.
