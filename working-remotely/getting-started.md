* If you have not already, complete [_CTM's CY19 Security Awareness Program_](https://cityofaustin.sharepoint.com/sites/LMS365/FY19%20Security%20Awareness%20Program/SitePages/Course.aspx)_._ 

## Software 

There are several tools available to staff for remote work. 

### Remote Desktop Applications

These options will enable you to remote into your city computer from your personal computer. This means you will have the same applications, configuration, etc. available to you at home as you do in the office, even if you do not have a city-owned laptop.

* \*\*\*\*[**Citrix Receiver**](citrix-receiver/) 
* **GoToMyPC** - Only recommended for customers with specific business needs. Requires your office computer to be powered up and connected to the network.

### Virtual Private Network Clients

You need to be on the City of Austin network to access various resources such as shared network drives, the HR Portal, the original CitySpace, and many City of Austin Sharepoint sites. 

When working remotely without an ethernet connection, you can use a VPN to access these resources and securely send and receive data. A VPN allows you to use a laptop computer or mobile device as if it were directly connected to a private network.

* \*\*\*\*[**NetMotion**](netmotion.md) _-_ NetMotion is the simplest VPN option. If you have a city-owned laptop, it most likely has NetMotion installed already. 
* **Cisco AnyConnect** - ****If you are working from a personal computer or a City-owned laptop without NetMotion, you will want to use Cisco AnyConnect. It requires a [more extensive set up](https://atx.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=bc5e00bddbe48414c56254f94896190e).
