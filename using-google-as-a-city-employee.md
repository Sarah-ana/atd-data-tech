# Using Google as a City Employee

We love Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides for collaborative document editing and management. Since CTM does not have an enterprise Google subscription, it is important that we follow the procedures below for account creation and file storage. Using Google within these parameters ensures that we can fulfill PIRs, follow records-retention policies, and maintain access to employees' work when they leave the City.

## Account creation

Employees should not use personal Google accounts for City work since all City-related email correspondence must reside in Office 365. So you will need to create a Google account with your `@austintexas.gov` email address that is not attached to a Gmail account: 1. Visit [Create your Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount&gmb=exp&biz=false&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp). 2. Click "Use my current email address instead."

1. Enter your `@austintexas.gov` email address. 
2. Check your email, including your junk/spam folder, and confirm your account.

## File storage

All of your documents should be saved within a folder owned by a shared resource account. For example, our main DTS Drive is owned by ATDDataTechnologyServices@austintexas.gov and we give everyone on our team access to the top-level folder. This means that we can all search and access each other's files, even if someone is out of office or leaves the team.

## Sensitive information

Under no circumstances should sensitive information be stored in Google Drive. This includes [CJIS](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/cjis-security-policy-resource-center) and [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) data.
