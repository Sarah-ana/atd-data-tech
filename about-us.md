## Our Work

### [Vision Zero Crash Data System](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/255)

This project seeks to centralize and streamline the management of ATD's Vision Zero data. As a result of this project, staff will have a standardized interface for reviewing crash data, prioritizing intersection safety improvements, and communicating efforts to the public. Additionally, high quality VZ data will be publicly accessible online.

### [Traffic Registry Digitization](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/129)

This is an effort to digitize all of our street regulations in a geospatial database, as well as set up sustainable processes to keep the Traffic Registry accurately maintained. The registry includes more than 50k regulations, and is currently managed in Access DB, without any spatial data features.
