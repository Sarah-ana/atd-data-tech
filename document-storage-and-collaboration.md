# Document storage and collaboration üìù üìö

## Collaborative Docum‚Äãents

To prevent the proliferation of different versions of multi-editor documents, all collaborative documents are stored on the cloud:

* [Document templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Txqc8xGkwa3h9lrRoXGzGjLlVo0S8DA6)
* ‚Äã[DTS Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fNmU-czryk5wJsn1gmb4WYUJJdut8Me7)‚Äã - [‚Äãaccount setup](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/wiki/Using-Google-as-a-City-employee)‚Äã‚Äã
* [DTS Sharepoint/Teams drive](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/tab::7dc26d1f-21aa-43dd-9dd9-ab25188b15a7/General?threadId=19:6125816a2bd34142a9b23fc916a968b8%40thread.skype&ctx=channel)

## Windows-only File Types

GIS files, Visio documents, and other files that can only be used on a Windows operating system are stored on the [ATD departmental network G drive](https://coacd.org/dfs/ATD).

## Sensitive Information

Sensitive information should be stored on the H Drive. This includes:

* Private employee information such as personnel-related files 
* [CJIS](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/cjis-security-policy-resource-center) and [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) data.

## Everything Else

Other documents can be stored either in the cloud or on the [ATD departmental network G drive](https://coacd.org/dfs/ATD), whichever is most practical for the team and customer.

Nothing should be stored on your local drive ‚Äî the Windows C drive or Mac HD. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è
